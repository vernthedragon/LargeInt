# LargeInt
Dynamically allocated integer datatype which has virtually unlimited maximum size and accuracy, as long as you still have memory. The datatype is stored on the heap and is very optimized for memory (for each new digit only 4 bits are allocated). A single header library written in C++ which is meant for scientific and data projects.
